# üîí Securing Cloud-Based Database Systems

This repository presents an analytical research project focused on the **security challenges and best practices** for protecting cloud-based database systems in the era of Big Data.

---

## Project Overview

This research explores how organizations can secure their data when using **cloud database solutions**.  
It analyzes key **security threats**, examines **real-world incidents**, and proposes a **multi-layered security framework** to improve data protection and compliance.

---

## Challenges Identified

- Data breaches and unauthorized access  
- Misconfigurations in cloud infrastructure  
- Insecure APIs and integration points  
- Data integrity and consistency issues  
- Compliance and regulatory challenges (GDPR, ISO 27001)

---

##  Best Practices Proposed

- **Encryption** ‚Äî Use AES-256 for data at rest and TLS for data in transit  
- **Access Control (IAM / RBAC)** ‚Äî Apply the principle of least privilege and multi-factor authentication  
- **Continuous Monitoring** ‚Äî Implement IDS/IPS and log auditing tools  
- **Regular Security Audits** ‚Äî Assess misconfigurations and vulnerabilities  
- **Cloud-Native Security Tools** ‚Äî Utilize CNAPP, DLP, and CSPM solutions
